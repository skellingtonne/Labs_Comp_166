   Lab 04: Making change Functions
   
   Lab 4 is the creating a program that makes change using the canadian currency denominations with seperate files for functions
    REQs
        1) Prompt for the total purchase price
        2) Prompt for the amount tendered
        3) Display the total amount of change due
        4) Compute and display the number and types of bills and coins in the change. 
        Assume that we have the following denominations: $20, $10, $5, $2, $1, 25¢, 10¢, and 5¢.
        5) Store all of the currency values and the denomination names in arrays.
        6) Repeatedly use the function changeItem() in a for loop.
        7) Consist of three files: two source files (makeChange.c, changeItem.c) and a header file
        (changeItem.h).
        8) Use #ifndef to prevent multiple inclusions of the header file
        9) Remember to include your header file in your changeItem.c so that the compiler will complain (in a
        convenient place) if you did not implement what you promised. You should always include
